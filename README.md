=========
e2iplayer plugin for Open Vision

This version won't install any kind of binary files for you as we use OE/BitBake to provide what's needed for each ipk.

Feed is needed to install RDEPENDS and if you just copy the files it won't work for you.

You could find the sources of rare binaries on https://github.com/OpenVisionE2
