=========
e2iplayer plugin for Open Vision

This version won't install any kind of binary files for you as we use OE/BitBake to provide what's needed for each ipk.

Feed is needed to install RDEPENDS and if you just copy the files it won't work for you.

* You could find the sources of rare binaries on https://github.com/OpenVisionE2
* Upstream: https://gitlab.com/zadmario/e2iplayer
